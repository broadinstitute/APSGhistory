# This file will enable you to configure static ip addresses for the
# provisioned nodes.
# 
# Specify the node's name and then the devices that you wish to configure
# followed by their configuration.
#
# You can also specify groups of nodes by implementing a wild card or a
# regular expression to match the node name. This is usually used in
# conjunction with either a DHCP configuration or internally used
# defaults.
#
# If there are multiple matches (e.g. a glob that matches a group of nodes
# followed by a more specific match) the last match gets the priority and
# all earlier matches are ignored.
#
# Usage:
#   nodename/pattern device(config options):ipaddr/netmask/gw device2:ipaddr/netmask
#
# The '[default]' entry will do different things depending on the field they
# are defined in.
#
#   ipaddr field:   Discovers the IP address via /etc/hosts.  If a
#                   ":string" is given, then it will key off of a
#                   different hostname in /etc/hosts.  NAME and NIC in
#                   a ":string" will be replaced by the nodename or
#                   device name, respectively.
#   netmask field:  By default it will take the configured netmask of this
#                   systems "private" network interface. If a ":string" is
#                   given, then it will use that device's netmask.
#   gateway field:  Like the netmask default option, it will locate the
#                   private network's ipaddress on this system and use that
#                   as the node's gateway. If a ":string" is given, then it
#                   will use that device's ipaddress.
#
# You may optionally supply other options to the network configuration that
# should be included in the network configuration (e.g. MTU=9000).  Use the
# '&' character to delimit multiple options.
#
# Examples:
#   * eth0:[default]/[default:eth1]/[default:eth1]
#   n0000 eth0:192.168.1.100/255.255.255.0/192.168.1.1
#   io* eth0(MTU=9000&OTHER=foo):[default]/[default]/192.168.1.1
#   foo eth1:[default:other_host_name]/255.255.0.0
#   spare eth0:dhcp eth1:dhcp
#
# Caution! Don't assign any static IP addresses in the DHCP range;
# otherwise, you may trample on another system's address.
#
# Note:  The ipaddr module currently generates network device
# configurations compatible with Caos, Red Hat, and SuSE Linux
# distributions.

# This default action will try and figure out what the IP address should be
# based on the master's /etc/hosts. If there is no entry in /etc/hosts for
# the node getting provisioned, it will fall back to DHCP.

* eth0:[default]/[default] eth1:[default]/[default]/[default]
