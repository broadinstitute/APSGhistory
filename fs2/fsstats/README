The fsstats tool collects and aggregates various statistics about the
files in a filesystem.  Full documentation is provided in POD format
in the "fsstats" file itself.  To read it, run
    % perldoc fsstats

You can also use "pod2man", "pod2html", etc. to translate the
documentation to other formats.

fsstats is designed to be portable to a wide variety of Perl versions,
and makes minimal requirements in terms of non-standard Perl modules.
One important caveat is that if your Perl is not compiled with 64-bit
integer support, files larger than 2 GB will not be tabulated
correctly.

fsstats is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  See the COPYING file for licensing information.
