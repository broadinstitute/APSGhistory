- make sure the root filesystem doesn't run out of space due
  to the irods log file
  - compress and optionally store old logs

- check that iRODS is running and responding on IES and resource servers
  - restart services if necessary
  - notify if major problems

- monitor the free space in the resources
  - notify admins if space goes below a certain threshold in
    any of the resource servers

- check iRODS responsiveness
  - set up a "test suite" using a set of known data objects
    and collections. 
  - make sure the contents of this "basket" maintains integrity
  - do timing on various operations and record over time to
    measure how the system scales up

Open questions:
- preferred monitoring framework if any?
