<h1><a name="name">NAME</a></h1>
<p>Basic task descriptions for the Dotkit administrator.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>This man page gives instructions to the administrator,
covering several common situations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="installing_dotkit_at_a_new_site">Installing Dotkit at a new site</a></h2>
<p>Here are a couple of basic pre-install questions to answer:</p>
<p>(1) Who will administer Dotkit for your site?
If there is more than one person,
it makes sense to set up a Unix group for Dotkit maintainers.</p>
<p>(2) Will any or all of them have root privileges?
This is not a requirement for Dotkit.
If you do use root, then group ownership of your Dotkit distribution
is less of an issue.
If you don't, it becomes more important.
(See <em>Preening the permission bits</em> below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_unpack_the_distribution_tar_file%2e">Unpack the distribution tar file.</a></strong><br />
</li>
One approach is to choose a location for dotkit that is visible to all users,
typically an NFS file system mounted on every machine at your site.
Putting all your eggs in one basket requires a reliable basket.
<p>Another approach is to put a copy of Dotkit on each host,
at, say, <em>/usr/dotkit</em> or <em>/etc/dotkit</em>.
Then change one master copy, and utilize a synchronizing tool
to push or pull changes to each host.
This requires more work, but may provide better service in
a large network.</p>
<p>For the sake of example, let's put Dotkit at <em>/foo</em>:</p>
<pre>
  % gunzip -c dotkit.tgz | (cd /foo; tar xf -)</pre>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_set_the_value_of_dk_root_in_your_current_shell_pro">Set the value of DK_ROOT in your current shell process.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<pre>
  % setenv DK_ROOT /foo/dotkit # csh or tcsh
  % export DK_ROOT=/foo/dotkit # bash or ksh</pre>
<li><strong><a name="item_make_necessary_soft_links%2e">Make necessary soft links.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<pre>
  % cd /foo/dotkit/etc
  % make links</pre>
<li><strong><a name="item_format_the_man_pages_and_html_documents%2e">Format the man pages and html documents.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<pre>
  % cd /foo/dotkit/man
  % make</pre>
<li><strong><a name="item_run_the_test_suite%2e">Run the test suite.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<pre>
  % cd /foo/dotkit/etc/test
  % make
  mutex1: ok (ksh) ok (bash) ok (csh) ok (tcsh) 
  recursive1: ok (ksh) ok (bash) ok (csh) ok (tcsh) 
   [ etc. ]</pre>
<p>All the tests should complete without error for each shell
you support.</p>
<li><strong><a name="item_write_dotkits_to_define_your_site%2e">Write dotkits to define your site.</a></strong><br />
</li>
If your site is named <em>foo</em>,
the convention for its Dotkit node name is <em>site=foo</em>.
It is also conventional to locate the <em>site=foo</em>
directory under <em>$DK_ROOT</em>,
but that is not a requirement.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_add_a_maintainer_file%2e">Add a maintainer file.</a></strong><br />
</li>
Create a one line file, $DK_ROOT/etc/DK_MAINTAINER, with
your name and email address.
This is read and output by the <em>use-usage</em> script,
also in the <em>etc</em> subdirectory.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_add_a_site_node_definition_file%2e">Add a site node definition file.</a></strong><br />
</li>
Create a one line file, $DK_ROOT/etc/DK_NODE.
It contains one or more colon separated pathnames
to your site specific Dotkit nodes.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_verify_that_etc%2fsystype_produces_correct_results">Verify that <em>etc/systype</em> produces correct results.</a></strong><br />
</li>
Each platform architecture at your site is expected to
have an associated <em>SYS_TYPE</em>.
The value of that environment variable is used by Dotkit
to find kits that are specific to the given platform.
<p>If $SYS_TYPE is pre-defined before initializing Dotkit,
that value is accepted.
Otherwise, <em>$DK_ROOT/init</em> calls the script 
<em>$DK_ROOT/etc/systype</em>,
which attempts to compute an appropriate value for <em>SYS_TYPE</em>.</p>
<p>If you have another system in place to define <em>SYS_TYPE</em>,
such as setting it in <em>/etc/profile</em>,
this step may not be necessary.
Dotkit will still work even if <em>SYS_TYPE</em> is unknown,
but it obviously will not find any <em>SYS_TYPE</em>-specific kits.</p>
<p></p></ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="supporting_the_dotkit_user">Supporting the Dotkit user</a></h2>
<p>A variety of problems may be presented,
some more common than others
Here is a list of things to check,
that will likely make the solution clear for the common issues.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a name="item_check_the_variables_related_to_dotkit%3a">Check the variables related to Dotkit:</a></strong><br />
</li>
Generate a list of Dotkit-related
environment and shell variables as follows:
<pre>
  (env;set) | grep -i dk | sort -u</pre>
<p>Five variables are essential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_dk_root%3a_the_location_where_dotkit_is_installed%">DK_ROOT: The location where Dotkit is installed.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_dk_node%3a_zero_or_more_additional_nodes_to_search">DK_NODE: Zero or more additional nodes to search.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item_dk_subnode%3a_the_sub%2ddirectories_within_a_node%">DK_SUBNODE: The sub-directories within a node.</a></strong><br />
</li>
<li><strong><a name="item__dk_rl%3a_the_current_recursion_level%2e">_dk_rl: The current recursion level.</a></strong><br />
</li>
The last variable (_dk_rl) should always have a value of -1
when your shell is at the prompt.
If it does not,
the most common cause is a keyboard
interrupt (Control-C) while the shell
is in the process of reading a dotkit.
Typing ``use'' with no arguments should restore the correct value.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item__dk_inuse%3a_list_of_packages_currently_in_use%2e">_dk_inuse: List of packages currently in use.</a></strong><br />
</li>
This is a whitespace-separated list of the packages that
have been used.
The trailing digit on each name is the recursion level
at which the package was encountered.
<p></p></ul>
<p>Some additional Dotkit-related variables may also appear.
<em>_dk_sev_FOO</em> is the saved value of an environment
variable named <em>FOO</em>,
which was reset by some package as it loaded.
The saved value will be restored to <em>FOO</em>
(and <em>_dk_sev_FOO</em> will disappear)
when the package is unused.</p>
<li><strong><a name="item_verify_they_are_finding_the_expected_dotkit%2e">Verify they are finding the expected dotkit.</a></strong><br />
</li>
Run <em>reuse -v foo</em>, where <em>foo</em> is the name of any dotkit
that seems to be mis-behaving.
This will show you exactly which file is ultimately being source'ed.
<p>Shell startup can get very complicated.
It is not unusual to load a particular dotkit,
and then have some other (non-Dotkit) command buried in an
obscure startup file change the PATH variable in
an unexpected way.</p>
<p>The user complains that kit <em>foo</em> is ``already loaded'',
but the component it was supposed to add to PATH isn't there.
Trying to ``use foo'' won't fix the trouble.
However, ``reuse foo'' is often a good strategy in this situation,
because it generally will make things work while you try to
figure out what really went wrong.
There is a special dotkit <em>reuse</em> that sets environment variable
<em>DK_UEQRU</em> to 1.
When this is so,
the <em>use</em> command always behaves as if <em>reuse</em> had been typed.
Some sites like to do this as a matter of policy.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_verify_that_%24dk_root%2finit_is_doing_the_right_t">Verify that $DK_ROOT/init is doing the right thing.</a></strong><br />
</li>
Normally, you <em>eval</em> the output of this script:
<pre>
  eval `/usr/gapps/dotkit/init`</pre>
<p>For debugging purposes, you can run it directly,
(take off the <em>eval</em> and the surrounding backquotes,)
and check that it is printing the correct set of commands
for your shell.</p>
<p>The init script emits a pair of shell-independent commands that
set the value of $DK_ROOT, if it wasn't set already,
then pass further processing on to a shell-specific script that
does the rest of the setup.</p>
<p>If your shell seems to be getting confused, (``export: command not
found'', or ``setenv: command not found'', or ``unbound variable'', or
``parameter not set'') it is possible to force
the init script to emit commands for a particular kind of shell.
Use the ``-b'' option to force Bourne-shell (bash or ksh) style initialization.
Use the ``-c'' option to force C-shell (csh or tcsh) style initialization.</p>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_look_at_the_output_from_use%2dusage%2e">Look at the output from <em>use-usage</em>.</a></strong><br />
</li>
The script <em>$DK_ROOT/etc/use-usage</em> is run whenever you
type ``use'' with no arguments.
You can also run it directly.
Verify that the list of packages on the first screen
matches <em>_dk_inuse</em>,
and that the Dotkit search path
matches the values in <em>DK_ROOT</em>, <em>DK_NODE</em>, and <em>DK_SUBNODE</em>.
Its arguments are documented at the beginning of the script.
<p></p></ol>

<h2><a name="adding,_changing,_or_removing_a_dotkit">Adding, changing, or removing a dotkit</a></h2>
<p>Decide where the new dotkit belongs.
If it is a personal preference,
it belongs in <em>$HOME/.kits</em>.
Otherwise, it may be part of
a group project, site-specific, or universal.</p>
<p>Group projects that want to define dotkits for their use
typically need to add a group node to DK_NODE before
initializing Dotkit:</p>
<pre>
  setenv DK_NODE /usr/local/share/&lt;project&gt;/kits
  eval `/foo/dotkit/init`</pre>
<p>Site-specific kits are added under the <em>site=XYZ</em> directory,
while universal kits are under $DK_ROOT itself.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/busby/dotkit/html/./dk-examples.html">the dk-examples manpage</a>(5) man page for a listing of Dotkit categories
and many example dotkits.
After your change is complete,
be sure to commit it to your source code management system,
and preen permission bits:</p>
<pre>
  % cd $DK_ROOT
  % ./etc/preen</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="updating_the_man_or_html_pages">Updating the man or html pages</a></h2>
<p>Source text for the man and html pages is located at <em>$DK_ROOT/man</em>.
The format is known as POD (Plain Old Documentation),
developed and distributed as part of the Perl language.
See the <em>perlpod</em>, <em>pod2man</em>, and <em>pod2html</em> man pages
for details on how to write and process POD files.</p>
<p>Briefly, modify the appropriate <em>*.pod</em> file in <em>$DK_ROOT/man</em>,
then run <em>make</em>.
If there are no errors,
this should reconstitute the formatted man and html pages.
You need to be on a platform where the full Perl distribution
is installed in order to run <em>pod2man</em>, etc.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="running_the_test_suite">Running the test suite</a></h2>
<p>Change directory to $DK_ROOT/etc/test,
and run <em>make</em>.
This should run a series of <em>mutex</em>,
<em>recursive</em>, and <em>simple</em> regression tests for
each supported shell.
You hope to see <em>ok</em> for every test and every shell.
If you do, it means that every file under the <em>dif</em>
sub-directory will be zero length.</p>
<p>If there is a problem,
you can inspect the corresponding <em>dif</em> file to begin
analyzing what went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="adding_an_motd_(message_of_the_day)">Adding an MOTD (message of the day)</a></h2>
<p>Create a file named <em>dk-news</em>,
located at <em>$DK_ROOT/etc</em>,
with the literal text of your message.
Every user who subsequently runs <em>use</em> without arguments
will see your text on the first splash page of output.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="preening_the_permission_bits">Preening the permission bits</a></h2>
<p>If a group of people administer Dotkit for a site,
it is best to create a Unix group,
say <em>dotkit</em>, with those users in it.
There is a script at <em>$DK_ROOT/etc/preen</em>,
which will attempt to make all the files under $DK_ROOT
have the correct group ownership and permission bits.
(Permissions are generally set to allow group write on
files and directories,
and world read/access/execute as appropriate.)
If the Dotkit administrative group does not use <em>root</em>,
then each dotkit administrator needs to run <em>preen</em>
whenever they change files,
to set the permissions on files that they own.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="making_a_tar_ball">Making a tar ball</a></h2>
<p>Change directory to <em>$DK_ROOT/etc</em>,
and run <em>make export</em>.
Anyone can do this,
as it does not change anything under $DK_ROOT.
(It does elide CVS subdirectories from the output tar file.)</p>
<p>The smallest tar file is made using
<em>make clean export</em> (note whitespace),
which throws away all temporary files, soft links,
and the formatted man pages.</p>
<p>A third option is <em>make cleanexport</em>,
which re-creates the formatted man pages before tarring up the result.</p>
