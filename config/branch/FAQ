Initialization:

  * Why does bash/ksh complain about "parameter not set", or "unbound
    variable" when I try to run eval `.../init`?

Answer: You have the "nounset" option turned on, either deliberately,
or inadvertently.  You can turn it off by typing "set +u" before running
the "eval" command.  Or you can give the "-b" option to init, to tell
it you want Bourne-shell style initialization.

The nounset option has its uses, but some older (buggy) versions of bash
and ksh have a hard time with Dotkit and nounset together.
