Here are some example dotfiles that show one way to integrate Dotkit
into your environment.  This is not necessary for using Dotkit, but it
shortens your dotfiles and makes it easier to share personal kits with
other people.

There is an example setup for use with each of bash, csh, ksh, and tcsh.
It should yield an environment that is very similar for any of those
shells.  Suggestions on how to improve the examples are always welcome.

A list of files and directories here:

bash_profile: Copy this to $HOME/.bash_profile, if you wish to
  run bash.

bashrc: Copy to $HOME/.bashrc, for bash users.

cshrc: Copy to $HOME/.cshrc, for csh and tcsh users.  This one file
  is designed to take the place of .cshrc and .login for most people.

kits/: Copy the whole directory to $HOME/.kits.  It provides
  some personalizable dotkits to set preferences and aliases.  It works
  with any of the four shells.

profile.ksh: Copy to $HOME/.profile, for ksh users.  This one file
  is designed to serve as both .profile and $ENV for most people.
