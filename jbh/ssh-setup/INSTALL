These scripts and template files set up a Moc OS X workstation to use
ssh tunnels to reach the VNC server on the SOLiD machines. These setup
scripts and the resulting tunnels assume that you have a working
passwordless ssh setup to gold.broad.mit.edu. If that is not the case,
you should set that up before proceeding. The script "sshconfig.sh" will
set up passwordless ssh to gold (and all broad hosts) for you. The rest 
of the scripts do the following:

  - (setup.py) Create an sshkey pair for each SOLiD/service
  - (setup.py) Create a plist file for each launchd listener
  - (installkeys.sh) Copy keys to gateway host (gold)
  - (loadservices.sh) Load/start services in launchd
  - (remove.sh) Crudely, very crudely, uninstall these services

To use, do: 

  - sshconfig.sh (optional, to set up passwordless ssh to broad hosts)
  - setup.py
  - installkeys.sh
  - loadservices.sh
  - open solids.html and test a few connections.
